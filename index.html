          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h1>
          <p>Serial launched on October 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2014 - it chronicled the the 1999 murder of Woodlawn High School student, Hae Min Lee, and the conviction of her ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed. Serial’s popularity kickstarted a sort of true crime renaissance - true crime stories didn’t have to follow the tired, by-the-numbers television formula anymore. However, since the medium is strictly in audio format, you no longer had a visual aid. That’s where this website comes in!</p>
          <p>The purpose of this website is to act as a supplemental visual product to use during, or after, listening to Serial season one. I can’t tell the story anywhere near as well as Sarah Koenig does… but I can help with the geography.</p>

          <h2>The Geography of Serial</h2>
          <p>When I first listened to Serial, I didn’t quite realize how close most the places of interest in this case actually are. The library really is as close as they explain it is - it’s actually closer to the school than the school running track is to the school. In the map below, you’ll see the Best Buy just to the west of the Woodlawn campus. Much closer than the drive test in Serial made it seem. If you start zooming out, you’ll quickly start to see other nearby locations - the park-and-ride, Leakin Park, the burial site, the residential lot Hae’s car was found in, and Adnan’s Mosque. Only Patapsco State Park, Owings Mill Mall, and Hunt Valley mall really stand out as being further away.</p>
          <p>As you’re using the maps, keep in mind that not all the locations mentioned in Serial are still around today. The Best Buy building is still there, but it’s no longer a Best Buy. The Lenscrafters no longer exist. Some of those involved in the case still live where they lived back in 1999, some don’t. Because of this, housing locations are displayed as general neighborhood area. All this geographic data was manually created and some of it could be slightly inaccurate, but it is probably as good as it gets without having full access to the police file. All routes were created using the fastest current times between two locations with Google Maps, unless otherwise noted.</p>

          <h2>Map Tools</h2>
          <p>The embedded Leaflet maps throughout this website are all interactive and let you perform several tasks. </p>
          <p>In the upper-left of the map, you’ll notice the zoom tools. The +/- buttons are fairly simple, clicking on them allows you to to zoom in and zoom out of the map. You can also just use your scroll wheel to zoom in/out if you don’t want to use the buttons. The third button in the upper-left of the map is the toggle fullscreen button. This button allows you to go in and out of fullscreen mode for the map - this makes exploring much easier. There is no difference in map functionality between the embedded and fullscreen versions of the map.</p>
          <p>In the upper-right of the map is the layer control button. When clicked you’ll notice three radio buttons and some checkboxes. The radio buttons allow you change the basemap. The checkboxes allow you to turn groups of features on/off in the map.</p>
          <p>In the lower-left of the map is the route control buttons. While not active in this particular map, these will allow you to go forward and backward between routes if the map has a list of routes. When clicked, the forward button will highlight and zoom to the bounds of the next route. The previous route (if there is one) will change to a dotted black line.</p>
          <p>Any non-button location on the map also has functionality, If you click on any features (icons, points, lines, and polygons) a popup will active with a description of what you clicked on. If you click anywhere else int he basemap, an alert window will popup and give you the coordinates of where on the earth you clicked - these coordinates can then be copied/pasted into Google Maps if you would like to explore elsewhere.</p>

          <h2>Don't Stop After Serial!</h2>
          <p>Much has happened since Serial season one's last episode. I would strongly encourage you to consume more content if/when you finish listening to Serial as some of the follow-up coverage of the case goes much deeper than Serial did. At a minimum, I would recommend listening to Undisclosed Season One, Episodes <a href="https://undisclosed-podcast.com/episodes/season-1/episode-1-adnans-day.html" target="_blank">One</a>, <a href="https://undisclosed-podcast.com/episodes/season-1/episode-2-haes-day.html" target="_blank">Two</a>, & <a href="https://undisclosed-podcast.com/episodes/season-1/episode-3-jays-day.html" target="_blank">Three</a> - those three episodes were just re-recorded in 2020. As well as watching the <a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-case-against-adnan-syed" target="_blank">HBO documentary</a>.</p>
