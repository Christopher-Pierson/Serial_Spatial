          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Hae Min Lee's Day</h1>

          <p>Hae’s whereabouts after school let out on January 13th, 1999, are shrouded in mystery. Whether you believe the State’s case, or not, the only physical evidence placing her in any specific location after 2:15PM is her body. Which wasn’t located until almost a month later, February 9th, in nearby Leakin Park. What happened to Hae in-between walking out of Woodlawn High School and ending up in Leakin Park? Without a confession we’ll probably never know for sure. However, we do know where she didn’t show up.</p>

          <p>Hae was supposed to be at Campfield Early Learning Center between 3:15-3:30PM to pick up her cousin. She was also scheduled to work at Lenscrafters that evening from 6-10PM. She no-showed for both, which was uncharacteristic of her. Because of this, it is reasonable to believe that she was already deceased or in a comprised position by the time she was supposed to pick up her cousin. This would appear to lineup with the State’s case, the the tight window of time notwithstanding. Since we cover the spatial side of the State’s case later, where else could Hae have headed after school? According to the police, Hae was supposed to travel with the Woodlawn wrestling team that evening to score a match. This supposedly backed up by multiple witness statements, as well as the Don note that was found in Hae’s car. I am skeptical of this for several reasons.</p>

          <p>First and foremost, there are police records of Hae being on the schedule and no-showing for work that evening. Even if she was supposed to work and there was a wrestling match, she strikes me as the type of person who would have rectified the scheduling conflict. Second, there is debate over what school the wrestling match was against, Randallstown or Chesapeake High School. Randallstown High can be found in the map just south of the Owings Mill Lenscrafters. I did not add Chesapeake High to any of the maps because it is nowhere near any other places of interest in this case and Hae never made it there even if it were the location of the wrestling match. Chesapeake High is a 32 minute from Woodlawn, located southeast of Baltimore (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/4798+Mountain+Rd,+Pasadena,+MD+21122/@39.1077771,-76.4632461,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b801feace0d40f:0x378edc4bbd30d5c8!8m2!3d39.1077771!4d-76.4610574" target="_blank">4798 Mountain Road, Pasadena, MD 21122</a>). In <a href="https://undisclosed-podcast.com/episodes/season-1/episode-2-haes-day.html" target="_blank">episode three</a> of Undisclosed, they give pretty compelling evidence that there was no wrestling match at all the evening of the 13th. Lastly, assuming the wrestling match was that evening and Hae still had to pick up her cousin, Hae would only have time to give Don the note if he was working at the Owings Mill Lenscrafters. This would contradict Don’s alibi, in which he claimed he was working at the Hunt Valley Lenscrafters. The Hunt Valley Lenscrafters can be found off-map, northeast of the Owings Mill location.</p>

          <p>Skepticism aside, did Hae have enough time to visit Don without jeopardizing her ability to pick up her cousin? In the map below, the fastest route from Woodlawn HS to Owings Mill mall to Campfield Early Learning Center is displayed. The total trip is 18.3 miles and would take 27 minutes. This would give Hae 48 minutes to account for walking to her car, waiting for the bus loop to clear, stopping to get snacks from Inez Butler-Hendrix’s concession stand, parking/walking to/from the mall, spending time with Don, and potential traffic. It is certainly doable, but seems unlikely that this trip would have exposed Hae to her killer.</p>
