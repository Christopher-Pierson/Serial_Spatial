          <div id="mapid"></div>

          <p>On February 9<sup>th</sup>, almost a month after Hae disappeared, Mr. S discovered Hae’s body in Leakin Park. In the time since Serial aired, it has been revealed that Mr. S’s real name is Alonzo Sellers - I will refer to him by his real name going forward. According to Mr. Sellers, he had stumbled onto the body during stop to take a leak in the woods. Something not mentioned in Serial, the route he stopped on would have required Alonzo to pull-over on the opposite side of the road because there is no shoulder on the side of the road he was driving. </p>
          <p>This stop was only 2.5 miles, approximately 7 minutes, away from this home and that was halfway to his destination, Coppin State University. This is one of the routes where the fastest route between points A-B (Alonzo’s home to Alonzo’s work) was not used as this is the route he would have had to have taken if his story is true. It was revealed in the <a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-case-against-adnan-syed/part-4" target="_blank">episode 4</a> of HBO documentary that Alonzo’s home is only a couple blocks from Woodlawn High School.</p>
          <p>The discovery of Hae’s body hastened the investigation and 19 days later Hae’s car is located after the police’s first interview with Jay. This interview also results in the arrest of Adnan. In the next four maps, we’ll look into the various collections of routes Jay and Adnan could have taken on the day Hae disappeared. It’s important to note that no matter what version of events you believe in, almost everyone involved seems to generally agree on everyone’s whereabouts from 7:15AM to 2:15PM on January 13<sup>th</sup>.<p/>
